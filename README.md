# Secure Drop

Secure Drop is a privacy-focused web application that enables users to share secrets—whether they’re text messages or images—with others in a secure and temporary manner. Here’s how it works: You upload your secret content, and Secure Drop generates a unique link. When the recipient opens the link, they can view the secret, but once they’ve seen it, it’s gone forever. Additionally, you can add an extra layer of protection by setting a password for the secret link.


- Upload text messages or images
- Receive a one-time-use link associated with the secret content..
- Share the link with your intended recipient.
- User-friendly interface built with React .
- When the recipient opens the link, the secret is revealed.
- After viewing, the secret is automatically deleted—no traces left behind.
- Optionally set a password for the secret link.
- Recipients must enter the correct password to access the secret.
